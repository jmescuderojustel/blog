Introduction

## Sustainable rhythm

- It is the key to making all the rest work
- If this is not met, all the other items in this list will be affected (quality, value added…)
- There is nothing wrong with short highs of effort, as long as they are the exception, not the norm

## Give value to the customer

- For each sprint, we need to provide a value increment (clear and evident)
- User stories must be related to the goals of the sprint and finally, to the goals of the project.

## Cost-time-scope relationship

- Understand the relationship
- Make it clear to the customer, and help them understand it (mainly when changes are requested)

## Quality is a must

- Bad quality means more time and cost in the long term
- Bad quality deteriorates customer confidence, as well as developer productivity

## Look for what customers need, do not just do what they want

- Know the customer’s business
- Understand the project’s context
- Understand why customers want what they ask
- Propose other ways, that may have not occurred to the customer

## Understand the value of customer’s money

- Sometimes is hard to understand that there is finally someone who works for earning the money that is paid to us to provide value

## Honesty (with customers and teammates)

- Assume errors (and learn from them)
- Ask for clarifications when something is not clear
- Ask for help when you can’t advance in a user story
- Be clear with customers and teammates (it is better to give bad news soon, rather than surprises)
- Be clear with your managers (don’t be afraid of assuming errors with them)
- Sometimes a “no” is a valid answer

## Be ready to teach and to learn

- Assume you don’t know everything: it is the only way for learning
- Be open to spending time teaching teammates: remember there was a time in which you were learning everything from scratch
- Anyone (with any seniority) can be a source of knowledge and inspiration. Listen.
- Improving the level of your teammates will improve the quality of the work and improve your daily tasks

## Be respectful

- Always, be it with customers and your teammates
- Understand all of us are just people, with different contexts. Anyone can have a bad day (the rest of the people too).

## Data

- Opinions should be defended with data when possible
- Try to get metrics, but without getting obsessed with them (gathering data is not the goal of a project, data is just another tool to improve)
- Data should trigger data, as data per se does not add value
