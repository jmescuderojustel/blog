When people think of software development, they often imagine developers typing away at their computers, coding for hours on end. However, the truth is that code-related jobs are much more than just writing code. From email management and time management to project management and quality assurance, there are many different tasks that make up a code-related job.

In this blog, I'll write about technology and software development, but also about all that stuff that surrounds our daily tasks. Everything included here represents my own opinion, so don't blame others if you don't agree with me on something :-)
